# **Networking Fundamentals**
-A network is a collection of devices connected toeach other to allow sharing of data.

## **Addressing**
  - 1]Physical address
  - 2]Logical address
  -    A]ipV6
  -    B]ipV4
        --  i]public ip
        -- ii]private ip


| **Aspect**               | **Public IP Address**                                  | **Private IP Address**                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Visibility**           | Visible on the internet                                 | Only visible within a local/private network             |
| **Assigned By**          | Internet Service Provider (ISP)                        | Network administrator or router (locally)               |
| **Uniqueness**           | Globally unique                                         | Unique only within the private network                  |
| **Access**               | Can be accessed from anywhere on the internet           | Cannot be accessed directly from the internet           |
| **Security**             | Less secure, needs firewall/NAT                         | More secure due to limited access                       |
| **Examples (IPv4)**      | 8.8.8.8, 172.217.3.110 (Google DNS, etc.)               | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255<br>10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255<br>172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 |
| **Used For**             | Communication over the internet                         | Internal communication within LAN                       |
| **Cost**                 | May cost money (static public IP)                       | Free to use internally                                  |





##**1. The OSI Model**

A seven-layer framework for understanding how networking systems communicate:

* **Application Layer**: Provides services for user applications.
* **Presentation Layer**: Manages data translation, encryption, and compression.
* **Session Layer**: Establishes and maintains connections.
* **Transport Layer**: Divides data into packets.
* **Network Layer**: Selects the best/shortest routing path.
* **Data Link Layer**: Converts packets into frames.
* **Physical Layer**: Converts into bit streams (binary) and sends via mediums like Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
