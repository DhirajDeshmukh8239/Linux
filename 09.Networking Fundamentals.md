# **Networking Fundamentals**

## **1. The OSI Model**

A seven-layer framework for understanding how networking systems communicate:

* **Application Layer**: Provides services for user applications.
* **Presentation Layer**: Manages data translation, encryption, and compression.
* **Session Layer**: Establishes and maintains connections.
* **Transport Layer**: Divides data into packets.
* **Network Layer**: Selects the best/shortest routing path.
* **Data Link Layer**: Converts packets into frames.
* **Physical Layer**: Converts into bit streams (binary) and sends via mediums like Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
