## Question 1:
**What is project?**

**Answer:** A project is like taking on a task that has a clear goal, a plan, and a deadline. 
## Question 2:
**What is application?**

**Answer** Application is a software program designed to perform specific tasks for user.

## Question 3:
**What is sdlc?**

**Answer** The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a step-by-step process used to plan, create, test, and deliver good-quality software in an organized and efficient way.
































































## ðŸ”„ SDLC Models Comparison Table

| SDLC Model  | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Waterfall Model** | Linear and sequential model; each phase must be completed before the next begins. | - Simple and easy to manage<br>- Clear documentation<br>- Ideal for smaller projects with fixed requirements | - No flexibility<br>- Late testing phase<br>- Poor for changing requirements |
| **Agile Model** | Iterative and incremental; development in small sprints with continuous feedback. | - High flexibility<br>- Continuous customer involvement<br>- Early delivery of working software | - Requires skilled team<br>- Difficult for large teams<br>- Documentation may be lacking |
| **Spiral Model** | Combines iterative development with systematic risk analysis. | - Risk assessment at each phase<br>- Suitable for high-risk, large projects<br>- Early identification of problems | - Complex and costly<br>- Not suitable for small projects<br>- Requires risk management expertise |
| **V-Model (Validation & Verification)** | Extension of Waterfall with testing phase aligned to each development stage. | - Early test planning<br>- Easy defect tracking<br>- High quality output | - Rigid and less flexible<br>- Not ideal for unclear requirements |
| **Incremental Model** | Software built in parts (increments); each adds functionality. | - Delivers working software early<br>- Easier testing and debugging<br>- Better risk management than Waterfall | - Planning required for each increment<br>- Integration issues can arise |
| **RAD (Rapid Application Development)** | Focuses on rapid prototyping and user feedback over long development cycles. | - Fast delivery<br>- User involvement<br>- Reduces development time | - Not ideal for large or complex systems<br>- Requires strong team and tools |
| **Big Bang Model** | Development starts with no formal planning; all resources used for coding. | - Simple to execute<br>- Good for academic or small projects | - Very risky<br>- Poor scalability<br>- No structure or clear documentation |
