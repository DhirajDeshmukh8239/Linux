## Question 1:
**What is project?**

**Answer:** A project is like taking on a task that has a clear goal, a plan, and a deadline. 
## Question 2:
**What is application?**

**Answer** Application is a software program designed to perform specific tasks for user.

## Question 3:
**What is sdlc?**

**Answer** The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a step-by-step process used to plan, create, test, and deliver good-quality software in an organized and efficient way.

## Question 4:
**What are steps in sdlc?**

**Answer**  Steps in SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):
- 1.Requirement Gathering â€“ Understand what the client needs.

- 2.Planning â€“ Check if the project is technically and financially possible.

- 3.Design â€“ Plan the architecture, UI, and data flow.

- 4.Implementation (Coding) â€“ Developers write the actual code.

- 5.Testing â€“ QA team checks for bugs and verifies functionality.

- 6.Deployment â€“ Software is delivered to users or clients.

- 7.Maintenance â€“ Fix issues and update the system post-deployme

## Question 5:
**What are models in SDLC?**

---

### 1. ðŸ”¹ Waterfall Model
**Definition:**  
The Waterfall model is a simple and step-by-step model where each phase must be completed before the next one begins.

**Steps:**  
`Requirement â†’ Design â†’ Implementation â†’ Testing â†’ Deployment â†’ Maintenance`

**Example:**  
Like building a houseâ€”first plan, then lay the foundation, then build walls. You cannot go back once you move to the next step.

---

### 2. ðŸ”¹ Agile Model
**Definition:**  
Agile is a flexible and fast model where the project is built in small parts called **sprints**. You get feedback from users after each sprint.

**Example:**  
Like creating a mobile app feature-by-feature and showing it to users every 2 weeks.

### 3. ðŸ”¹ Spiral Model
**Definition:**
The Spiral model combines design and prototyping with frequent risk analysis. The project is developed in loops (spirals), and each loop addresses risks.

**Example:**
Like designing a carâ€”test each prototype with safety checks before building the next version.

### 4. ðŸ”¹ V-Model (Verification and Validation)
**Definition:**
An extension of the Waterfall model where testing is planned in parallel with development. Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase.

**Example:**
Like preparing for an exam and testing yourself after each topic.

### 5. ðŸ”¹ Incremental Model
**Definition:**
In this model, the software is developed and delivered in small chunks (increments). Each increment adds a new feature.

**Example:**
Like building a restaurant menu one section at a timeâ€”first drinks, then starters, then main course.

### 6. ðŸ”¹ RAD (Rapid Application Development) Model
**Definition:**
RAD focuses on fast development and quick delivery with user involvement through prototypes.

**Example:**
Like quickly creating a sample of a website, showing it to the client, improving it, and finalizing it.

### 7. ðŸ”¹ Big Bang Model
**Definition:**
The Big Bang model is used for small projects with very little planning. Developers start coding with the available resources.

**Example:**
Like cooking a new recipe without a plan or ingredients listâ€”just start and adjust as you go.


## Question 6:
**What is Deveops?**

**Answer:**
-DevOps is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops)
- DevOps is all about automating processes, and continuously improving the software development
- and deployment pipeline to deliver products quickly and reliably

- Linux is widely used in servers, cloud systems, embedded devices, and mobile phones (like Android).


## Question 8:
**What is Operating System**

**Answer**
- An operating system (OS) is a system software that manages computer hardware and software resources
