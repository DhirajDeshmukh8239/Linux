## Question 4:
**What is Open Source?**

**Answer:**  
Open source refers to software whose source code is freely available for use, modification, and distribution by anyone.

---

## Question 5:
**What is Virtualization?**

**Answer:**  
Virtualization allows multiple OS instances to run on a single physical machine using a hypervisor.

---

## Question 6:
**explain hypervisor and its types ?**

**Answer**
A hypervisor is software that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine (host). It creates, runs, and manages these VMs, each with its own operating system and resources.

## üî∞ Types of Hypervisors

### 1. Type 1: Bare-Metal Hypervisor
- Runs **directly on physical hardware**.
- Does **not require a host OS**.
- Offers **better performance and efficiency**.
- Common in **enterprise environments**.

---

 ### 2. Type 2: Hosted Hypervisor
- Runs **on top of a host OS** (like a normal application).
- Easier to install and use.
- Slightly **lower performance** than Type 1.
- Ideal for **development/testing environments**.

## Question 7:
**Difference b/w SDLC and STLC**

**Answer**
| Aspect    | SDLC                            | STLC                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Full Form | Software Development Life Cycle | Software Testing Life Cycle |
| Focus     | Software development process    | Testing process             |
| Involves  | Developers & Testers            | Mainly Testers              |

---


## Question 8:
**Types of Design Document in SDLC?**

**Answer:**  
- High-Level Design (HLD): system structure, database design.

- Low-Level Design (LLD): logic for individual modules


---


## Question 9:
**What is the difference between user space and kernel space?**

**Answer:**
- User space: Where user applications run (isolated from the kernel)
- Kernel space: Where the OS core runs (full access to hardware)

---


## Question 10: 
**What are system calls in Linux?**

**Answer:**
-System calls are functions used by user programs to request services from the kernel (like reading a file, creating a process)

---

## Question 11:
**What are the differences between monolithic and microkernel architecture?**

**Answer:**
- Monolithic Kernel: All components run in kernel space (Linux uses this)

- Microkernel: Only core services run in kernel, others run in user space (e.g., Minix)
  
---

## Question 12:
**How is the Linux kernel different from a microkernel?**

**Answer:**
The Linux kernel runs all essential components inside one kernel space, while microkernels run components separately in user space for modularity.

---

## Question 13:
**Name different types of shells.**

**Answer:**
- Bash (Bourne Again Shell)

- Sh (Bourne Shell)

- Csh (C Shell)

- Zsh (Z Shell)

- Ksh (Korn Shell)

---

## Question 14:
**Name and explain some IPC mechanisms in Linux.**

**Answer**
- Pipes: One-way communication between processes

- Message Queues: Send/receive messages

- Shared Memory: Multiple processes access same memory block

- Sockets: Communication over network or between processes**

---

## Question 15:
**What is Inter-Process Communication (IPC)?**

**Answer:**
IPC allows processes to communicate and share data. It‚Äôs essential for multitasking.

---

## Question 16:
**What is global configuration file**

**Answer**A global configuration file in Linux is a system file (usually in /etc) that sets rules or settings that affect all users on the computer.


---

## Question 17:
**Types of Kernel**

**Answer**
1. Monolithic Kernel
- All core services (like memory management, file systems, device drivers) run in kernel space.

2. Microkernel
- Only basic services (like inter-process communication and scheduling) run in kernel space.

- Other services (like drivers, file systems) run in user space.

3. Hybrid Kernel
- Combines the features of monolithic and microkernel.

 4. Exokernel (Experimental)
- Very minimal kernel that gives applications direct access to hardware.

## Question 18:
**List five command start from ls**

**Answer**
| Command | Use                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| `lsblk` | Lists block devices like disks |
| `lscpu` | Shows CPU details              |
| `lsmod` | Lists loaded kernel modules    |
| `lspci` | Lists PCI devices              |
| `lsusb` | Lists USB devices              |

## Question 19:
**How was Linux discovered?**


**Answer**
Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 while he was a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland.
He wanted a free and open-source alternative to UNIX, so he built a new operating system kernel and shared it online.
Many developers around the world helped improve it, and that‚Äôs how Linux was born and became popular.
